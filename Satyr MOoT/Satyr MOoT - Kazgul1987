	name : "Ram", // Required; name of the weapon

	source : ["HB", 0], //required; the source and the page number. "HB" stands for homebrew. See the "Complete SourceList" for an overview of sources that are already defined. Or define a new source using the "Homebrew Syntax - SourceList.js". // This can be an array of arrays to indicate the things appears in multiple sources.

This example is 2d4 worth of piercing damage. //if you want the amount of dice to be an amount determined by the Character Level, then put "C" as the first value.
